**Repository:** `rdf-pbac`  
**Description:** `This repository provides an Apache Jena plugin to enable fine-grained, policy-based access control (PBAC) of RDF data. Used by secure-agent-graph.`

## Overview  
This repository contributes to the development of **secure, scalable, and interoperable data-sharing infrastructure**. It supports NDTP’s mission to enable **trusted, federated, and decentralised** data-sharing across organisations.  

This repository is one of several open-source components that underpin NDTP’s **Integration Architecture (IA)**—a framework designed to allow organisations to manage and exchange data securely while maintaining control over their own information. The IA is actively deployed and tested across multiple sectors, ensuring its adaptability and alignment with real-world needs. 

For a complete overview of the Integration Architecture (IA) project, please see the [Integration Architecture Documentation](https://github.com/National-Node-Net/integration-architecture-documentation).

## Prerequisites  
Before using this repository, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  
- **Required Tooling:** 
    - Java 17
- **Pipeline Requirements:** 
    - Cloud platform credentials
- **Supported Kubernetes Versions:** N/A
- **System Requirements:** 
    - Java 17

## Quick Start  
Follow these steps to get started quickly with this repository. For detailed installation, configuration, and deployment, refer to the relevant MD files.  

### 1. Download and Build  
```sh  
git clone https://github.com/National-Node-Net/rdf-pbac.git
cd rdf-pbac
```
### 2. Run Build  
```sh  
mvn clean install
```

which creates the `rdf-pbac-fuseki` module for Fuseki.
### 3. Usage

To use the library directly in your project:

```xml

    <dependency>
      <groupId>uk.gov.dbt.ndtp.jena</groupId>
      <artifactId>rdf-pbac-lib</artifactId>
      <version>VERSION</version>
    </dependency>

```
#### Use with Apache Jena Fuseki
This project uses the Apache Jena Fuseki Main server and is configured with a
Fuseki configuration file.

See [documentation](docs/pbac-fuseki-server.md) for details on how to run the library within a local Fuseki Server.

See "[Configuring Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/fuseki-configuration.html)"
for authentication.

## Features
- **Key Functionality**  
   - RDF PBAC consists of a PBAC security engine, an extension module for [Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/),
and a security evaluation service to provide security verification
to non-JVM components of the system.
   - Every triple carries a security label. Which labels a request may see is decided by a
policy engine ([Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)) or, when no policy engine is
configured, by evaluating each label as an attribute expression against the user's attributes.
- **Key Integrations**  
    - Enhances access control for the [secure-agent-graph](https://github.com/National-Node-Net/secure-agent-graph) project.  
- **Scalability & Performance**  
    - Optimised for high-throughput environments.
- **Modularity**  
    - Designed as a modular component of NDTP’s Integration Architecture (IA).  
    - Includes the `rdf-pbac-fuseki` module for Fuseki.  
    - Usable as a library in other projects via Maven dependency management.  

## Modules

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| `rdf-pbac-lib` | The PBAC security engine: labels, label stores, attribute expressions and policy decisions |
| `rdf-pbac-fuseki` | Fuseki module that applies PBAC security to Fuseki datasets |
| `rdf-pbac-fuseki-server` | Runnable Fuseki server jar with PBAC included |
| `rdf-pbac-eval` | Standalone service for evaluating attribute label expressions |
| `rdf-pbac-coverage-report` | Aggregate test coverage report |

## PBAC Documentation  
Documentation providing further details on the individual modules is provided [here](docs/pbac.md ). 

This repository was forked from [rdf-abac](https://github.com/National-Node-Net/rdf-abac). Java packages
have moved from `uk.gov.dbt.ndtp.jena.abac` to `uk.gov.dbt.ndtp.jena.pbac`, and classes named `*ABAC*`
are now named `*PBAC*` (for example `DatasetGraphABAC` is now `DatasetGraphPBAC`).
